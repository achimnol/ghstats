GitHub repository statistics
============================

Requires Python 3.6 or higher.

```console
# recommended to create a virtualenv
$ pip install -U -r requirements.txt
$ python stats.py
```

Change the global variables such as the repository list, username, and date ranges before use.

To change the GitHub login user after authentication, just delete `/tmp/ghstats.token` and run the script again.
